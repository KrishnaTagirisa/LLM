What is a ReACT Agent?
    ReACT stands for Reasoning and Acting. It's a type of intelligent agent that:
    Reasons about what it knows (uses thinking to solve problems).
    Acts to get more information if needed (like doing a Google search or using a calculator).
    Combines both to solve tasks step-by-step.

This is useful when the agent doesnâ€™t have all the answers right away, and needs to do something to get them (like a human might look something up or do some math).

ðŸ§  How is it different from normal AI chat?
        A regular chatbot gives you a direct answer.
        A ReACT agent can think out loud and use tools (like search engines, calculators, or databases) to get better answers.

ðŸ§ª Simple Example: ReACT Agent Solving a Question
    Task:
        "What is the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located?"

    Step-by-step by a ReACT Agent:
        Step 1: Thought (Reasoning):
        "The Eiffel Tower is in France. I need to find the capital of France."

        Step 2: Action:
        "Use a knowledge tool to look up: Capital of France."

        Step 3: Observation (Result):
        "The capital of France is Paris."

        Step 4: Final Answer:
        "Paris."

ðŸ”§ Example With a Tool (like Calculator)
        Task:
        "What is the square root of the sum of 49 and 51?"

        Step 1: Thought:
        "49 + 51 = 100. Then, I need the square root of 100."

        Step 2: Action:
        "Use calculator to compute square root of 100."

        Step 3: Observation:
        "Square root of 100 is 10."

        Step 4: Final Answer:
        "10."

ðŸ§  Summary
    A ReACT Agent:
        Thinks step-by-step.
        Uses tools when needed.
        Solves problems like a smart assistant with both brain and hands.
